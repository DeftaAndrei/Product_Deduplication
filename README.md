# Product_Deduplication


Let's filter and put the descriptions together 

Read - View parquet file

Convert - We turn it into an excel to see it better

Processing - We are thinking in several ways how we can process the file

I realize that it takes a lot of time to process the parquet file in python in the Procesing_Parquet file that's why I think that if we want to do this, it's better to do it in Scala

I thought that I needed to analyze the problem thoroughly. Specifically, I considered analyzing the columns in Excel in a way that would allow me to extract data from the description while ensuring a secure duplicate. I also attempted to compare data by URL in the file Process_Parquet.py and tried to compare by Name. It's a product-related issue, and I believe that with websites, I am not entirely sureâ€”I mean, two companies could have the same site.
